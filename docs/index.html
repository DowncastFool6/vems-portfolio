                <h2>Objective</h2>

                <p>My objective as a Full Stack Developer is to design, develop, and maintain robust, secure, and scalable web applications by effectively combining front-end and back-end technologies. 
                I aim to strengthen my proficiency in core programming languages, modern frameworks, and development best practices, while gaining hands-on experience across the full software development lifecycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am particularly focused on building well-structured user interfaces, implementing reliable server-side logic, working with databases, and integrating APIs to deliver complete, functional solutions. 
                Continuous learning is a central goal, allowing me to improve code quality, adopt industry standards, and apply secure coding principles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In the long term, I seek to grow into a versatile and dependable developer who can contribute meaningfully to development teams, add value to real-world projects, and progress toward advanced roles in web and application development.
